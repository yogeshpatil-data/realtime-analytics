Project: Real-Time Clickstream Analytics Platform

Design and implement a real-time data pipeline that ingests high-volume user clickstream events, processes them using PySpark Structured Streaming, applies aggregations and data quality checks, and serves curated data in Snowflake for analytical use cases. The system handles late-arriving data, ensures fault tolerance, and is orchestrated with Airflow.
